# CareCircle

CareCircle is a parental monitoring app that balances the need for children to have privacy and autonomy with the need to keep children safe. The app flags messages which contain potentially dangerous or harmful content, which are visible to both parent and child in a mockup of the child's texts. If a message is not flagged, the parent cannot see the content, but can see that a message was sent and its metadata.

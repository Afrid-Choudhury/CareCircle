## üèÜ Testing Strategies for the CareCircle App
To ensure the CareCircle app works as expected, the following testing strategies were implemented:

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Tools:** JUnit, AndroidX Test Library
- **Example:**
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun testEmailValidation() {
      val email = "test@example.com"
      assertTrue(isValidEmail(email))
  }

  @Test
  fun testInvalidEmail() {
      val email = "invalid-email"
      assertFalse(isValidEmail(email))
  }
  ```
- **Results:**
  - Valid email (`test@example.com`) passed.
  - Invalid email (`invalid-email`) failed as expected.

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Goal:** Ensure various modules of the app interact seamlessly.
- **Tools:** Firebase Test Lab, AndroidX Integration Testing

  @Test
  fun testSignUpButtonClick() {
      onView(withId(R.id.signUpButton)).perform(click())
